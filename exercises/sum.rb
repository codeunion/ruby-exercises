# Method name: sum
# Input: a list of numbers
# Returns: the SUM of all the numbers in the list
# Prints: Nothing
#
# In English, the "sum" method takes as input a list of numbers and
# returns the SUM of all the numbers in the list

# Things we'll need:
#   1. Something to keep track of the running total
#   2. Something that goes through the list one number at a time
#   3. Something that adds the current number to the running total
#
# For (3), consider these bits of Ruby:
#   total = 10           # assign the value 10 to the variable "total"
#   total = total + 5    # the value of "total" is now 15
#   total = total + 20   # the value of "total" is now 35
#   total = total + 7    # the value of "total" is now 42
#   total = total - 10   # the value of "total" is now 32 (notice the minus)
#   total = total + 70   # the value of "total" is now 102

def sum(list)
  # This is your job. :)
  total = 0

  list.each do |num|
    total += num        # Adds the current number to the running total variable
  end
    
  return total

end
