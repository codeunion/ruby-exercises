# Method name: word_count
# Input: A string representing an English sentence
# Returns: The number of words in the sentence
# Prints: Nothing
#
# Although it's more complicated in relaity, we'll just pretend
# that sequence of spaces in a sentence designates the start of a new word.
# That means we don't care about how many spaces are between two words, only
# that there is at least one.

  p word_count("") == 0  # Empty string
  p word_count(" ") == 0 # A string consisting of a single space

  # It's probably worth having a few more sanity checks.
  # What are some input strings that might be tricky to handle?
  # How about where the answer to "How many words?" is less clear-cut?
