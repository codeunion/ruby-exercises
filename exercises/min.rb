# Method name: min
# Input: a list of numbers
# Returns: the SMALLEST number in the list
# Prints: Nothing
#
# In English, the "min" method takes as input a list of numbers and
# returns the SMALLEST number in that list.

# Your job here is to fill in the ______.  Be deliberate, don't just guess!
# The number of spaces (____) is meaningless; it's not as if four blank spots
# means you need to replace it with a 4-character chunk of Ruby.

# This is going to be very similar to max, so don't be afraid if
# these two methods look almost identical
def min(list)
  current_min = list.first  # Assigning a value to current min so you can compare (it can by any number)
  list.each do |num|
    if num < current_min    # Determining whether the current number in the loop is smaller than the current_min
      current_min = num     # If it is smaller, the new current_min is the smaller number
    end
  end

  return current_min
end
