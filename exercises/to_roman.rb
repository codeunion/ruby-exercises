# Method name: to_roman
# Inputs:      A number
# Returns:     A String representing the number in roman numerals
# Prints:      Nothing

# to_roman takes a number as input and returns that number using Roman numerals
# See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals

# It can be tricky to handle the cases where "IV" means 4.  As a first pass,
# don't hesitate to implement a simpler version where 4 is denoted by "IIII".
#
# Remember: the priority is FEEDBACK, even if your implementation can't handle
# every single case.
